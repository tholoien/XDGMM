# XDGMM
This is a Python class for using Gaussian mixtures to do density estimation of noisy, heterogenous, and incomplete data using extreme deconvolution (XD) algorithms which is compatible with the scikit-learn machine learning methods. It implements both the [astroML](http://www.astroml.org/index.html) and [Bovy et al. (2011)](https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution) algorithms, and extends the BaseEstimator class from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) so that cross-validation methods will work. It allows the user to produce a conditioned model if values of some parameters are known.

## XDGMM Algorithms
The code currently supports the [astroML](http://www.astroml.org/index.html) and [Bovy et al. (2011)](https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution) algorithms for XDGMM fitting and sampling. 

**Compatibility note:** Versions of astroML prior to May 20, 2015 contain a bug that causes an error with scoring samples. We recommend using later versions of astroML in order to avoid this.

## Machine Learning
This class is compatible with cross validation methods from [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). See the demo for an example of this functionality.

## Other Capabilities
XDGMM also allows the user to produce a conditional XDGMM distribution given values for some of the parameters used to create the model. For example, if parameters A, B, and C were used to fit a model and the value of C is known, you can produce a model for just parameters A and B that is conditioned on the known value of C.
